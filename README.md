Applying automated feature engineering to the [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

This repository documents my application of featuretools for automated feature engineering in a Kaggle competition. The complete set of notebooks can be viewed and run on Kaggle. I have also included manual feature engineering notebooks for comparison purposes. The competition is still ongoing and I will update with new results and notebooks as they are completed.
